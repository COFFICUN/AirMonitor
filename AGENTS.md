# AirMonitor Agent Instructions

## Project context

AirMonitor is an IoT air-quality monitoring system.

The repository currently contains:

- AirMonitor v1: the stable diploma implementation based on Flask and SQLite;
- AirMonitor v2: a new portfolio-oriented implementation that will use FastAPI,
  PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Docker, tests, and CI/CD.

AirMonitor v1 must remain functional and must not be rewritten during the
initial AirMonitor v2 migration.

## Current task scope

For the `feature/v2-bootstrap` branch, work only inside the `backend/`
directory, except when creating or updating agent-specific documentation.

Do not implement PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Docker, authentication,
Redis, MQTT, or frontend migration during this task.

## Protected legacy files

Do not modify these AirMonitor v1 files:

- `app.py`
- `index.html`
- `test1_final.ino`
- `init_db.py`
- `schema.sql`
- root `requirements.txt`
- `secrets.example.h`

## Sensitive files

Never open, read, display, copy, modify, or include content from:

- `secrets.h`
- `.env`
- `.env.*`, except public example templates
- `*.pem`
- `*.key`
- `*.db`
- `*.sqlite`
- `*.sqlite3`
- `.venv/`
- `venv/`

Never print credentials, Wi-Fi settings, private keys, certificates,
database contents, or local secrets.

## Technical requirements

- Use Python 3.13.
- Use FastAPI.
- Use `APIRouter` for route organization.
- Use an application factory function.
- Use type hints for public functions.
- Use Pydantic response models where appropriate.
- Keep modules small and focused.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Do not duplicate logic.
- Use pytest for automated tests.
- Use FastAPI `TestClient` for endpoint tests.
- Keep runtime and development dependencies separate.
- Add meaningful docstrings only where they explain design intent.
- Do not add trivial comments that repeat the code.

## Git safety

Do not:

- commit changes;
- push changes;
- amend commits;
- rebase;
- reset;
- run `git clean`;
- force push;
- change branches;
- modify Git configuration.

The user will review and commit changes manually.

## Commands

Create the backend environment from the repository root:

```powershell
py -3.13 -m venv backend/.venv
